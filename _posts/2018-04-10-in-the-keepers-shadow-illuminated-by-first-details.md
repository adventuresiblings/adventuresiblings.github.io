As developers begin to fully understand the emotional power of video games, more and more are choosing to embrace the interactive medium as a vehicle for telling personal, dramatic stories. The latest such studio to do so is Lonely Egg, whose upcoming point-and-click adventure In the Keeper&#8217;s Shadowrepresents &#8220;a fantastical retelling of co-founder Jessica Fong’s visionary world and her portfolio of over 10 years of work expressing her family’s struggle to confront their history with child abuse.&#8221;

Story details are sparse so far, but the game stars a &#8220;young, inquisitive girl&#8221; named Emi, who in &#8220;seeking to be noticed and heard&#8221; undertakes a journey to &#8220;unearth secrets amidst the crumbling, war-torn city she’s called home.&#8221; It&#8217;ll be up to players to &#8220;help Emi understand and confront an ever encroaching twisted psychological and physical landscape.&#8221; Through a combination of &#8220;audio logs, artifacts, atmospheric sound, and complex characters,&#8221; you must begin to piece together a story that will &#8220;connect with echoes of the past and ponder themes of love, despair, compassion, inner strife, and closure.&#8221;

The early promotional materials for this &#8220;intimate hand-painted adventure&#8221; show off Fong&#8217;s talent as an artist in depicting a world of &#8220;dystopian surrealism.&#8221; In action, the goal is to present a game with &#8220;unique cinematic environments for a dynamic hand-crafted, story-book feel,&#8221; accompanied by an atmospheric score with full voice acting from its characters. Exploration will be controlled via keyboard/mouse (or gamepad), with a variety of puzzles to solve along the way, immersing players in &#8220;both the larger, more scripted events, as well as many small mechanical interactions that connect them with Emi’s personality and experience.&#8221;

Produced in partnership with Serenity Forge, the release of In the Keeper&#8217;s Shadow is still a way off, with a target completion date slated for sometime next year on Windows and Mac. While you wait, you can learn more about the game through the <a href="https://www.lonelyegg.com/games/itks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>.
