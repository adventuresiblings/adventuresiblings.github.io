The theme of treasure hunting is very popular among literature, films and games. Rogue Quest is not an exception, but it struggles to make it somewhat different.

<!--more-->

You play the role of Cassandra Nech, a member of the renowned Rogue’s Guild and you just discovered the treasure of the infamous Sea Tyrant, a past warlord. But, your mission has been compromised and you have to find a way to claim the riches and save yourself.

Rogue Quest is a short game. And by short, I mean that the game took me about 30 – 40 minutes of gameplay, but since I wanted to get all the achievements on Steam (I’m an achievement junkie) and the time recorded was 50 minutes. For those who started playing adventure games in the 90’s such as myself, you feel like the game is trying a little to hard to remind you of that era. Classic point and click, third person perspective, if the game had a more intriguing storyline, it would have been more memorable.

The game graphics are pixelated and it was developed with the Unity engine. The characters are well designed. The background feels repetitive, it has only a couple of scenes all and all (the game takes place at a cave, but I wanted a bit more creativity). The puzzles were easy. Too easy perhaps. Simplistic puzzles, mostly inventory based and one or two, you find clues on how to proceed.<figure id="attachment_73" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

The music is boring. I don’t know if it’s the fact that is a free music sample, but I kept hearing the music and didn’t pay that much attention in the game. The sound effects were plain at best. What would have made significant difference would have been voice overs. It’s a rather short game and voice overs would have been easy to record.

I really wanted to like Rogue Quest. Having played the studio’s previous game and liked it, I was hoping to meet the same. But, it lacked the details to make this game interesting. But, I’m expecting more from Expera Studios in the future.

_**2.5/5**_
