If you know cats, you know they like to play by their own rules. So imagine a whole society of cats! Yeah, bedlam. It should come as no surprise, then, to find out that it&#8217;ll up to you to bring order to a whole city of felines that has begun to run amok in indie South African developer Silvernode Studios&#8217; upcoming _Nine Noir Lives_.

<!--more-->

_Nine Noir Lives_ is set in Meow Meow Furrington, the &#8220;capital city of cats, cartels&#8230;and crime. A city that will just as soon claw your eyes out as lick your face.&#8221; Above and beyond even the usual level of criminal activity, now the &#8220;most infamous murder&#8221; the city has ever seen is threatening to &#8220;spill into the city like an overturned saucer of milk and ignite a war between the powerful Montameeuw and Catulet families.&#8221; Fortunately, this mystery gives experienced detective Cuddles Nutterbutter his big break. But beware, as &#8220;while he&#8217;s hunting down a murderer, someone else is hunting him.&#8221;

should be immediately obvious, this pun-filled game is all-cats-all-the-time. Inspired by the genre classics, it&#8217;s a beautifully hand-drawn adventure that promises to be &#8220;full of humour, crazy characters, and intriguing locations&#8221; to explore. Along the way, there will be &#8220;mind-bending puzzles to solve&#8221; in between all the licking. Yes, licking! As a feline yourself, your motto will be &#8220;lick first – ask questions later&#8221; as you &#8220;learn more about the world through the time-honoured approach of licking everything. Everything.&#8221;
