While most interplanetary games are serious science fiction, outer space and comedy have alway gone hand-in-hand in the adventure genre. And so they will once again next year with the release of indie Australian developer Bad Goat Studios&#8217; Henry Mosse and the Wormhole Conspiracy.

The titular star is a teenager who &#8220;helps his mother, Seren, operate Mosse Family Supplies – an interstellar delivery business servicing the outer-worlds.&#8221; But Henry is bored and wants more from his life, so when a &#8220;too-good-to-be-true business opportunity whisks Seren off to a strange alien resort at the outer fringe of known-space, Henry seizes the opportunity for adventure; stowing himself aboard the family ship to investigate.&#8221; He gets more than he bargained for, however, when &#8220;the Mosses uncover a cosmic conspiracy overseen by the sinister Benedict Wormhole, head of ubiquitous mega-corp, Wormhole Industries.&#8221; Now it&#8217;s up to mother and son to undertake a galactic journey that will fulfill &#8220;a secret legacy founded a generation ago.&#8221;

Inspired by the Golden Era genre classics, Henry Mosse promises to touch on &#8220;themes of independence, family, compassion, coming-of-age and morality – all set within a zany universe designed to bring a smile to players of all ages.&#8221; The game&#8217;s early screenshots and trailer show off some of the eye-popping hand-drawn visuals to be found in over 40 environments across five &#8220;lore-rich&#8221; worlds. There will be puzzles to solve along the way, but here each obstacle promises &#8220;multiple pathways&#8221; that will allow players to approach them in different ways. And if you still get stuck, there will be &#8220;helpful gadgets&#8221; to help you out of your predicament. Just be mindful of your choices, as &#8220;some decisions may lead to lasting consequences.&#8221;

In order to bring this sci-fi adventure &#8220;set in a goofy galaxy of oddball characters, ridiculous conundrums and cosmic evil&#8221; to gamers by the middle of next year on Windows and Mac, a Kickstarter will be launched soon to help get Henry Mosse and the Wormhole Conspiracy to the finish line.
