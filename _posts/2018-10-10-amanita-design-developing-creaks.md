Normally a well-oiled machine developing creaks is a sign of wear and tear, but context matters when the machine is Amanita Design and the _Creaks_ in question refer to the name of their next adventure.

Amanita is keeping the &#8220;surreal&#8221; story behind _Creaks_ secret for now, but then plot has never really been the primary focus of the acclaimed indie Czech developer behind modern classics like _Samorost_, _Machinarium_ and _Botanicula_. What we do know, however, is that _Creaks_ represents the studio&#8217;s first departure from a point-and-click control scheme, so get ready for a little keyboard and gameplay manipulation this time around. Rest assured, however, that Amanita has confirmed to Adventure Gamers that the gameplay is still &#8220;very much&#8221; puzzle-based.

One look at the first screenshots and trailer are proof that the new game will once again feature the gorgeous graphics we&#8217;ve come to expect – the sketch-style artwork, somewhat muted palette, and more technologically-oriented nature of the settings seen so far most closely resembing _Machinarium_. And once more, the action will be accompanied by an impressive instrumental score, here supplied by Scottish composer and multi-instrumentalist Joe Acheson, aka Hidden Orchestra.

While neither specific platforms nor launch date have yet been revealed, _Creaks_ will be appearing on PC and consoles sometime in 2019.
