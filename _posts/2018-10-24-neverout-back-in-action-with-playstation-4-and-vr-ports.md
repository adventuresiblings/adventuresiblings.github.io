You&#8217;ve heard of thinking outside the box? Well, get ready to think inside the cube in _Neverout_, a _Portal_-esque puzzler that has just been ported to new platforms.

As with the 1997 cult classic film _Cube_, in _Neverout_ players awaken inside a &#8220;claustrophobic trap&#8221; that you&#8217;ll need to escape. Even when you overcome the first obstacle, however, you&#8217;ll find that this is just the first of more than 60 increasingly difficult room challenges standing in the way of your freedom. Players will encounter &#8220;numerous deadly obstacles, such as electric fields or spiked traps,&#8221; and &#8220;just one small mistake&#8221; can prove fatal.

The game plays out in first-person 3D and has been designed for VR with &#8220;immersive and comfort modes included,&#8221; though it can also be experienced on normal displays. In order to help you overcome your many trials, you will need to &#8220;use teleports, small moving cubes or even change the plane of movement which shifts gravity, causing the elements that are not fixed to the ground to fall.&#8221; Quick reflexes won&#8217;t hurt as you try to avoid being crushed or impaled, but ultimately success &#8220;all really depends on your wits and careful decisions.&#8221;

_Neverout_ was first released in May 2017 and has since been available on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Gear VR, as well as a non-virtual reality version on Switch. Today, however, another port of the game is being released for <a class="external" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/neverout-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 4 and PSVR</a>, with a single purchase unlocking your preference on either Sony console.
