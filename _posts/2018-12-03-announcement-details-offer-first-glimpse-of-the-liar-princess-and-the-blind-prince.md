Fairy tales warn us to beware wolves in sheep&#8217;s clothing, so to speak, but what if the wolf just really wants to help correct a fateful mistake? Such is the basis for the upcoming fantasy side-scrolling adventure, _The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince_.

When a young prince hears a lovely song, he sets out to find its singer, unaware that the voice belongs to a lonely wolf. Unfortunately, &#8220;upon finding its source, the prince inadvertently startles the wolf, who blinds him by accident.&#8221; Now helpless, the prince is locked away so the wolf feels compassion and &#8220;seeks to free him and restore his sight.&#8221; In order to do that, however, she agrees to give up her singing voice in exchange for the ability to become a human princess. Together the two must &#8220;embark on a dangerous journey to bring the prince to the witch of the forest and heal his eyesight.&#8221;

This &#8220;haunting fairy tale of love and loss&#8221; is presented in a true storybook hand-drawn aesthetic, but don&#8217;t let its beauty fool you, as &#8220;the forest is home to a number of hostile creatures intent on ending your journey prematurely, as well as hazardous traps that put the prince in danger.&#8221; You are able to transform between the wolf and princess at will, and &#8220;various obstacles will require the wolf&#8217;s strength, and others will require the princess&#8217;s wit.&#8221; Along the way, you can also collect petals, each of which contains a &#8220;fragment of memories shared by the wolf and the prince.&#8221;

In order to play The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince when it&#8217;s released at the end of March 2019, you&#8217;ll need either a PlayStation 4 or Nintendo Switch. For those who do, the game will be available in standard form or a deluxe &#8220;Storybook Editon&#8221; containing the soundtrack CD, hardcover art book, and collector&#8217;s box while supplies last exclusively at the _[online NIS America store](https://store.nisamerica.com/preorders/the-liar-princess-and-the-blind-prince)_.
