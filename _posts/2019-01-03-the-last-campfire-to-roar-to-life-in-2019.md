Normally it&#8217;s best to prevent a fire from roaming freely through a forest, but it&#8217;s okay when that fire is _you_ and you&#8217;re really just trying to get back home, as in Hello Games&#8217; upcoming short adventure, _The Last Campfire_.

The game thrusts players into the role of a &#8220;lost Ember trapped in a puzzling place, searching for meaning and a way home.&#8221; As you &#8220;travel deeper into the lands beyond the dark forest and overcome the adversities before you,&#8221; your adventure will allow you to &#8220;discover beautiful wilderness filled with lost folk, strange creatures and mysterious ruins.&#8221; Throughout this experience, you must &#8220;find hope and carry it with you on your journey to light The Last Campfire.&#8221;

The early screenshots and teaser show off some of the charming 3D environments players will visit in their travels, as might be expected from the designers of the 2008 puzzle-platformer _LostWinds_. This game is no platformer, however, instead focusing more on puzzle-solving and adventure. It&#8217;s not expected to be a long experience either, as the game represents a &#8220;Hello Games Short,&#8221; an initiative akin to Pixar shorts whose aim is to &#8220;foster creativity and new voices in the studio.&#8221;

No firm target release date has been announced, or even specific platforms just yet, but at the very least we know _The Last Campfire_ is expected to <a class="external" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990630/The_Last_Campfire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release on Steam</a> sometime in 2019.
