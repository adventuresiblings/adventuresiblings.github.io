She and the Light Bearer is a blend of a music album and adventure game that borrows its aesthetic from storybook and fairy tales. The game put emphasize in the art, poem, dialogue, and music to deliver a story about forest and Mother.

In She and the Light Bearer, players will assume the role of Firefly and help her find Mother that will decide the fate of the forest all creatures live in.

The project was born from a prototype made during Mojiken Camp, an internal upgrading program by Mojiken Studio. The prototype, titled She Who Was Once Lost, has smaller scale and very different gameplay, but helps Brigitta Rena, the creator of the game, to explore her visual artistic direction and expand the idea into grander series that will start with this game.

Welcome to the forest,  
O Bearer of Light.

Come and see  
beings of fairy tale  
who welcome thee.

Dancing grasses, laughing flowers,  
in hope and tears, the Forest cheers.

Come and hear  
stories and wisdom,  
treasured so dear.

Stay and ponder, stay and wander.  
Learn the wisdom, reach the answer.

Come in deeper,  
O Light Bearer,  
into the Forest&#8217;s heart.

Where the light fails to penetrate  
and the truth slumbers so deeply.

Come and find&#8230;  
find the Mother.
