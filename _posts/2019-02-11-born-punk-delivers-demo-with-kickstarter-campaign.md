Cyberpunk seems to be making a welcome resurgence in gaming these days. The latest title to delve into a dystopian future of high tech and lowly station is indie developer Insert Disk 22 – at least, they will if they&#8217;re able to secure the necessary crowdfunding for Born Punk on Kickstarter.

The year is 2155, when the Danish island of Bornholm has been &#8220;transformed from a quaint holiday getaway with some interesting history to a proper mega-city, governed by a corporate council called The Conglomerate.&#8221; After a decade working as a &#8220;corporate combat hacker,&#8221; 34-year-old Eevi Rinasdottir is &#8220;forced to return to the place of her humble beginnings, to work as a barkeep for her foster father, and to dream of returning to the glittering corporate lifestyle she had grown used to.&#8221; Unbeknownst to Eevi, however, an &#8220;electronic entity has infected her cyberdeck,&#8221; and when it manifests itself she begins suffering what is &#8220;essentially a digital multiple personality disorder.&#8221; As she seeks &#8220;answers about the nature of the intruder, either come to terms with it or try to expel it from her body,&#8221; matters go from bad to worse when Eevi uncovers &#8220;a conspiracy that could change humanity&#8217;s future forever.&#8221;

While Born Punk&#8217;s pixel art is &#8220;tinted darkish and cyberpunkish&#8221; and the game promises to touch on &#8220;many genre-typical themes like AI rights, human augmentation and the power of corporations,&#8221; the developers want their retro-styled adventure to &#8220;portray the world as one that has not lost the last spark of hope.&#8221; During the course of the game, players must help the protagonist &#8220;solve logical puzzles, advance the story via dialog with the game&#8217;s diverse characters, and decide whether it is brains or brawns that will serve her best – for every choice, there is a consequence.&#8221;

The emphasis on player agency means that many puzzles will have alternate solutions, often involving &#8220;dichotomies between violence/peace, subterfuge/honesty, and egotism/altruism.&#8221; Adding to your options will be the discovery of &#8220;lore&#8221; items, which aren&#8217;t necessary to complete the game but unlike in most adventures, here such objects provide knowledge that &#8220;can be used for puzzles or dialogs to produce different outcomes.&#8221; You&#8217;ll also get to make use of Eevi&#8217;s augmentations, as &#8220;she is able to hack into electronic devices, use her artificial titanium claws to attack or defend herself, and her cybernetic eye gives her insight that is hidden from &#8216;normal&#8217; humans.&#8221;

To showcase Born Punk, a <a href="https://insertdisk22.itch.io/born-punk-kickstarter-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playable demo</a> has been released for Windows, Mac and Linux, offering an early slice of the full game in which Eevi must get ride of an &#8220;ungodly hangover&#8221; and then overcome her malfunctioning electronic door security to get to her nightly &#8220;data drill.&#8221; (Or, if you&#8217;d rather, you can simply watch an extended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&v=VjiCnyK0BGs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gameplay video</a> of the same demo.)

In order to complete the game, the small indie Australian development team has launched a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/insertdisk22/born-punk-a-cyberpunky-classic-point-and-click-adv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise nearly $10,000 (US) by March 7th. If all goes well, we could be seeing Born Punk released on PC, consoles and mobile devices beginning as early as January 2020.
