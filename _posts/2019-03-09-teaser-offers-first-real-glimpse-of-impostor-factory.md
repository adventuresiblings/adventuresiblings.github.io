Fans of Freebird Games (_To the Moon_) have not one but two bits of news to celebrate, one for now in the form of a comics collection, and another for later with the first teasing glimpse of their upcoming adventure, _Impostor Factory_.

<!--more-->

Details are sparse for the new game, though the teaser hints at the same kind of RPG-style pixel art that Freebird fans will find instantly familiar. This time, however, &#8220;in a stark shift from the developer&#8217;s past story structure style, players will take part in a time-resetting thriller-mystery that involves a series of bloody murders.&#8221;

While you wait for _Impostor Factory_ to arrive sometime in 2020 for Windows, Mac and Linux, you can immerse yourself in _Paper Memories_, a &#8220;50-page comic including stories from _To the Moon_, _Finding Paradise_, and the Sigmund Corp. doctors.&#8221; This collection, illustrated by Puré and co-written by series creator Kan Gao, can either by preordered in <a class="external" href="https://freebirdgames.bigcartel.com/product/pre-order-paper-memories-printed-comic-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">physical print form</a> or purchased now as <a class="external" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1028420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digital DLC on Steam</a>, the latter coming with bonus music tracks based on Freebird&#8217;s games.
