#### **_To light the candle is to cast a shadow._**

Behind the veil of reality, lies an enchanted world. When the world lost its balance, it fell upon a boy to take on an unexpected journey. Until the moon rises again, the order of the world will not be restored. One cannot go back in time to correct his mistake. Whatever happened is irreversibleâ€¦or is it?

Together with our main character and his mystery friend, players will experience a unique adventure that requires both courage and determination. Enter the ancient tower that stands at the edge of the world, help the character bring back his lost memories and find out the darkest secret beyond the tower itself.

LUNA &#8211; The Shadow Dust is a story driven point & click adventure puzzle game  
Game Platform:  
The game will be available on PC / MAC / Linux.

_Traditional frame by frame character animation_  
Who can resist not using this time consuming, expensive and bonkers animation technique in a game?! People might say we are crazy. We agree.

_Single player mode with Dual character control_  
How many things can go wrong when you need to control 2 characters at the same time? Yes, a LOT. But double the difficulty means double the fun&#8230; and&#8230; double the difficulty.

_Think outside of the box of the box_  
In order to solve the puzzles, not only your logic will be challenged but also your reaction speed, music sensibility and, most importantly, your imagination.

_LESS reading, MORE cinematics_  
We replaced the dialogue system with a series of stylized cinematic animations. No matter where you&#8217;re from, human or Martian, you will have fun playing this game!

_Interactive Original Music_  
We are so serious about the music that our musician has sold her soul to the game music devil.
