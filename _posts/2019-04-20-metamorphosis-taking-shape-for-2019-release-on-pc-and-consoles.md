Pulse Entertainment&#8217;s _Bad Mojo_ showed us in 1996 that being an insect can be a lot fun (in a game, that is). Now indie Polish developer Ovid Works is revisiting the concept in their upcoming Kafka-esque environmental puzzler _Metamorphosis_.

Salesman Gregor Samsa mysteriously finds himself transformed into a &#8220;tiny bug and embarks on a quest to save himself and his friend Joseph, who has been arrested for reasons unknown.&#8221; Unfortunately, Joseph &#8220;can&#8217;t recognize your new arthropodal body,&#8221; thrusting you into a &#8220;perilous journey through a strange world which, like yourself, has turned twisted and unfamiliar.&#8221; You must rely on your wits to &#8220;unravel the truth and return to the life you once knew,&#8221; but at this size, what once seemed so mundane has now &#8220;become an expansive obstacle course. Youâ€™ll have to leap, climb, and chart your path by using your newfound abilities to navigate the dingy nooks and crannies that exist within the cracks of civilization.&#8221;

As its title would suggest, the game is inspired by Kafka&#8217;s short story &#8220;The Metamorphosis&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a straight adaptation, however, but rather a &#8220;tribute to his strange, haunting, darkly comic worlds.&#8221; Presented in stylized first-person 3D that &#8220;adds a layer of the fantastical to even the grittiest environments,&#8221; _Metamorphosis_ promises to offer &#8220;challenging environmental puzzles that have you searching for clues, creating diversions, and overcoming obstacles.&#8221; You&#8217;ll encounter a number of &#8220;eccentric, colorful characters spanning the world of both humans and insects&#8221; along the way, and exploration will involve &#8220;unique movement mechanics that make full use of your tiny body and sticky limbs.&#8221;

Production on _Metamorphosis_ is creeping steadily along, and the game is currently on track for a <a class="external" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1025410/Metamorphosis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-external="true">PC release on Steam</a> sometime &#8220;soon,&#8221; along with PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch versions. In the meantime, you can follow its progress through the <a class="external" href="http://metamorphosisgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-external="true">official website</a> while you wait.
